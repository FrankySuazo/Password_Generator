# Password_Generator
Another personal project I did, which can generate a random password for the user through console.log. In this project I experiement the global veriables by editing them, could effect the function from outside and give you a complete diferrent result! Want a password with numbers only? How about symbols, and no uppercase? Only want lowercases with more than 100 characters? Go ahead and give it a try!
